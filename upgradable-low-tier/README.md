# Upgradable Workers (and Artisans)

![](./banner.png)

Skyscraper-like upgrades for worker and artisan residences.

## Requirements

- Activated DLC `High Life` (the game requires you to activate latest when you load a savegame)
- `[Shared] Ground Textures`
- Either `[Shared] Extra Goods Collection` or DLC `Docklands`

## Buildings

You can either use the skyscraper upgrade button (recommended), or the build menu as a fallback in case of mod conflicts.

Use short-cut "I" to get into skyscraper upgrade mode before unlocking engineer/investor skyscrapers.

There is no cross progression from upgraded residences to their next population tier.
You have to downgrade to normal residences first - just like the skyscrapers handle it. This is due to technical reasons.

### Workers

- Level 1: 30 workers
- Level 2: 40 workers
- Level 3: coming soon

### Artisans

- Level 1: 50 artisans
- Level 2: 70 artisans

### Farmers

- `[Addon] Pescatarians` workers and artisans provide extra farmer workforce.

### Stone Pavement

- Also function as street.
- Adds Shift+V variations with this ground to some of the City Lights Pack ornaments.

## Products

All products are available as Dockland imports, or can be produced with `[Shared] Extra Goods Collection`.

- Canned Fish
- Cheese
- Suits
- Tools

## Known Issues

- (workers only) The game always prefers one direction when building a single row of houses. You have to rotate such a building everytime you place or upgrade it or its neighbors.
- The arrows for skyscraper update doesn't show sometimes. But the building will still upgrade if you click anyway.

## Changes

### 2.0

- Added Artisans ðŸ¥³
