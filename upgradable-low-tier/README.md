# Upgradable Workers

![](./banner.png)

[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno-1800-jakobs-mods)

Skyscraper-like upgrades for worker residences.

## Requirements

You need DLC `High Life` activated to play this mod.
You also need the mod `[Shared] Extra Goods Collection` or DLC `Docklands`

## Workers

- Level 1: 30 workers
- Level 2: 40 workers
- Level 3: coming soon

You can either use the skyscraper upgrade button (recommended), or the build menu as a fallback in case of mod conflicts.

## Artisans

Coming soon.

## Farmers & Artisans

You need more dense farmer buildings? Have a look at `[Addon] Pescatarians`.
Their Artisans provide +10 farmer workforce per house.

## Stone Pavement

- Counts as street
- Variations of City Lights Pack ornaments with a fitting ground texture are included.

## Notes

Hint: use short-cut "I" to get into skyscraper upgrade mode before unlocking engineer/investor skyscrapers.

Using this mod will force you to activate skyscraper DLC in your savegame if you started without.

Known issues:

- The game always prefers one direction when building a single row of houses. You have to rotate such a building everytime you place or upgrade it or its neighbors.
- The arrows for skyscraper update doesn't show sometimes. But the building will still upgrade if you click anyway.
- The game wrongfully shows missing cheese for normal worker residences when all needs are fulfilled but people have not moved in yet. It's just an icon, nothing is missing.
