# New Town Hall, as Buildings

![](./banner.png)

The building version of this mod enables the new town hall as separate buildings.

If you do not need the tower versions and prefer shift+v variations you can use the other mod.

The variation and building versions are completely separate and can be activated/deactivated to your liking.

## How it works

The new town hall is the same as the original town hall. Except it may cost a few coins more :)

The city hall tower is more expensive to maintain, but has a small buff to decrease maintenance cost of surrounging skyscrapers.

You can upgrade from the new town hall to the city hall tower by pressing "U" or using the upgrade cursor.
