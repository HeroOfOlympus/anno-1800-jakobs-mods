# New Town Hall, as Buildings

![](./banner.png)

[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno-1800-jakobs-mods)

## Notes

- You need the High Life DLC.

- This mod ("as Buildings") enables the new town hall as separate buildings.

  If you do not need the tower versions and prefer only shift+v variations you can use the other mod ("as Variations").

  The variation and building versions are completely separate and can be activated/deactivated to your liking.

  âš  Please always update both, if you use both. They share models and textures to reduce GPU memory usage.

- Works with existing save games.

## How it works

The new town hall is the same as the original town hall. Except it may cost a few coins more :)

The city hall tower is more expensive to maintain but has a small buff to decrease maintenance cost of surrounding skyscrapers.

You can upgrade from the new town hall to the city hall tower by pressing "U" or using the upgrade cursor.

### New Town Hall

- Unlock: 500 artisans
- Menu: after original town hall in artisan and city menu.

### City Hall Tower

- Unlock: 3000 investors
- Menu: after original town hall in artisan and city menu. Also after elevators in investor menu.

The tower has 3 item slots, but if you like to use 4 instead you can change the mod as follows:
- Open `[Misc] New Town Hall, as Buildings/data/config/export/main/asset/assets.xml`
- You'll find `<SocketCount>3</SocketCount>` at line 93. Change that number into 4.
