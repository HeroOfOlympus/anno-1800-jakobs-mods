[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno-1800-jakobs-mods)

The docklands gate connects modules across streets to keep atractiveness bonus.

The building is available in the docklands module construction.

Note: the menu has no scroll option. It may not show if you already have too many modules.
