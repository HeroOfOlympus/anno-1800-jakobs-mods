[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno-1800-jakobs-mods)

## Notes

- You need "Land of Lions" DLC and the mod "[Shared] Extra Goods Collection".
  Products like Linen (LoL) and basic needs like Cheese (Extra Goods Collection) are required! 
- Optional: use "[Misc] Residence Skin Pack" to change the default look of Pescatarians to differ from the main game.
- Works with existing save games.

## How it works

Pescatarians don't eat meat thus have changed needs.
They like to live together as a community across tiers, thus higher tier residences include some lower tier workforce as well.

- Alternative residences (same workforce, different needs)
  - Farmers (10 farmers)
  - Workers (15 workers + 7 farmers)
  - Artisans (20 artisans + 7 workers + 7 farmers)
  - Engineers (30 engineers, accept both normal and pescatarian needs)
- Alternative engineers can be upgraded to normal skyscrapers or investors.
- Pescatarians want a "Community Center" instead of a market place.
- Workers and artisans residences
- New productions
  - Basic: cheese (milk)
  - Basic: olive soap (olives)
  - Basic: canned fish (ore, fish, olives)
  - Basic: suits (linen, wool) + linen from hemp
  - Luxury: wooden accessories (wood)
  - Luxury: tools (iron, wood)
  - Luxury: bottled beer (malt, hops, glass)
- Suit and canned fish factories reduce needs when close to residences.
- Artisan residences get several skins with the "[Misc] Residence Skin Pack".
