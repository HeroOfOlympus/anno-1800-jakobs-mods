# Biogas Plant

[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno-1800-jakobs-mods)

The biogas plant converts waste from pig and cattle farms into gas for use in power plants.

Needs "The Passage" DLC activated.

## Notes

The mod comes with two buildings.

The farm waste depot provides a buff to nearby pig and cattle farms to produce extra farm waste.

The biogas plant processes farm waste into gas.

Biogas: 1,33/min using 4x waste
Waste per farm: 0,16/min or 0,33/min with silo

You need 10 pig farms (or 5 with silos) to fully power a normal gas power plant.

You find the biogas production embedded in the gas and small power plants construction menus.
