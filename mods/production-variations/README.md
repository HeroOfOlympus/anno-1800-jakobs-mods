# Production Variations

Shift+V variations for production buildings.

AI will also build these variations.

âš  If you are missing ground textures: make sure to update `[Shared] Ground Textures`.

Buildings:

- Fur Dealer: 3 new variations
- Bakery: 2 new variations (+ Shift+G for stone pavement)
- Cannery: 2 new variations
- more will follow ...

## Notes

Buildings marked as `<QuestObject />` do not allow Shift+V after being placed.
This mod removes the tag from the buildings.
It may lead to odd side effects on quests.
None have been observed so far.

## Changes

### 1.2

- Fixed mirrored bakery sign
- Changed stone pavement from skin to Shift+G due to annoying paintbrush button position

### 1.1

- Added bakery variations
