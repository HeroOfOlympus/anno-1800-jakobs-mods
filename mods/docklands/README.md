# Docklands Gate

[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno-1800-jakobs-mods)

The docklands gate connects modules across streets to keep atractiveness bonus.

The building is available in the docklands module construction.

Note: the menu has no scroll option. It may not show if you already have too many modules.

The module is also available in the NW when you play with [New World Docklands](https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/215). New World Docklands needs to be loaded first to work. I suggest you rename the folder to "[Gameplay] New World Docklands".
