# Nearby Production Buffs

[Project on GitHub](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno-1800-jakobs-mods)

Decreases consumption of a need by 30% when residents live close to a producing factory of that need.

This is a great way to encourage some layout changes!

## Notes

The buffs apply up to engineers (without their skyscrapers).

- Work Clothes (farmers, workers)
- Schnapps (farmers, workers)
- Sausages (workers only)
- Bread (workers, artisans)
- Beer (workers, artisans)
- Canned Food (artisans, engineers)
- Sewing Machines (artisans, engineers)
- Fur Coats (artisans, engineers)

Works with Pescatarians, Upgradable Workers.
Does not work with Harbor Life or any other mod adding custom residences.
