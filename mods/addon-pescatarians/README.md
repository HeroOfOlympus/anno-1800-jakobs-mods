Alternative Old World population providing with new needs, productions and workforce twists.

## Requirements

- DLC `Lands of Lions DLC` + Mod `[Shared] Extra Goods Collection` mod for production chains.
- Or alternatively DLC `Docklands`
- Optional: Artisan skins are included in Mod `[Misc] Colored Roofs, Residences`.

## Population

### Pescatarians

- Pescatarians provide Farmer/Worker/Artisan workforce in equal shares.
  For example 3 Pescatarian residents provide a workforce of 1 Farmer, 1 Worker and 1 Artisan.
- All Pescatarians residences have the same population, but different number of residents and consumed products.

### Upgrade to Engineers

- You can upgrade Pescatarians to Engineers, but Engineers are vanilla population.
  Once upgraded, a downgrade will lead to vanilla Artisans.
