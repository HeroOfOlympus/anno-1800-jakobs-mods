# Small Gas Power Plant

![](./banner.png)

The small gas power plant consumes less gas for reduced range.

## How it works

The building behaves exactly the same as the normal gas-fired power plant.

Cost and maintenance are reduced to half.
Range is reduced to half - meaning coverage is even less than half.
That makes the small version less cost effective, except when combined with buffs or in restricted build situations.

Influence, palace and guild house buffs apply.
