# Small Gas Power Plant

![](./banner.png)

The small gas power plant consumes less gas for reduced range.

## How it works

The building behaves exactly the same as the normal gas-fired power plant.

Cost and maintenance are reduced to half.
Coverage is reduced to 40%.
That makes the small version less cost effective, except when combined with buffs or in restricted build situations.

Influence, palace and guild house buffs apply.
